/// Stops a named installed application, resolving its processes here and now.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The whole point of this executor is <em>when</em> it looks. The server knows
/// only what inventory last told it, and inventory is collected on request rather
/// than continuously -- a process list measured on this fleet was ninety minutes
/// old. A pid chosen from that is a guess about a machine that has since carried
/// on: the process may have exited, restarted under a new pid, or had its pid
/// reused by something unrelated. Enumerating on the endpoint closes that gap to
/// the width of this method.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The task names an application and an install directory, never a pid or an
/// image name. Those are derived here from live state, so nothing upstream --
/// including a browser -- can choose which process gets terminated.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Termination itself goes through the same <see cref="IServiceProcessControl"/>
/// used by the existing per-process task, so the refusal to touch pids 0 and 4
/// and the image-name re-check at kill time both still apply. This adds a way to
/// decide <em>which</em> pids; it does not add a way to kill.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The looking and the stopping are <see cref="ApplicationStopper"/>, shared
/// with <see cref="RemoveApplicationExecutor"/> so that "stop" means one thing
/// wherever it is promised. What this executor owns is the meaning of the
/// report: "not running" is the state the operator wanted, and "nothing could
/// be stopped" is a failure.
