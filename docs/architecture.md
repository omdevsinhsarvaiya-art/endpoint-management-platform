## Trust boundaries

The platform has **two separate API hosts** and they are never merged
(ADR-0001):

| | Admin API | Agent API |
|---|---|---|
| Principal | Human administrator | Enrolled machine identity |
| Authentication | Session/token (Phase 3) | Device credential (Phase 1) |
| CORS | Explicit dashboard allow-list | **None** (machine-to-machine) |
| Port | 5080 | 5081 |
| Process | `EndpointPlatform.Api` | `EndpointPlatform.AgentApi` |

A stolen device credential must never reach administrative surface, and an
administrator session must never be replayable against agent endpoints. The
separation is enforced by architecture tests
(`EndpointPlatform.Architecture.Tests`), which fail the build if either host
references the other.

Agents only make **outbound** connections. No inbound port is ever opened on an
endpoint, and there is no unauthenticated server-to-agent command path.

## Layering rules (enforced by tests)

1. `Domain` references nothing: no EF Core, no ASP.NET, no other project.
2. `Contracts` is dependency-free — every byte ships to every endpoint.
3. `Infrastructure` never references either API host.
4. The API hosts never reference each other.
5. Agent Windows-API usage lives only in `EndpointAgent.Windows`, behind
   interfaces declared in `EndpointAgent.Core`.
6. Agent assemblies do not reference process creation or the PowerShell SDK at
   all (ADR-0005).

## Data architecture

Single PostgreSQL database, schema `endpoint_platform`, snake_case naming.
One EF Core `DbContext` (modular monolith — ADR-0002). Two database roles
(ADR-0003):

- **owner** (`endpoint_owner` locally): DDL; used only by the migration job.
- **runtime** (`endpoint_app` locally): DML only; used by both APIs. Holds
  `SELECT, INSERT` — and nothing else — on `audit_log_entries`, and cannot
  perform DDL.

The audit trail is append-only through three independent layers (ADR-0004):
an EF save interceptor (developer error), revoked UPDATE/DELETE privileges
(compromised app credential), and BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE triggers
(any role short of the table owner).

Redis is cache/queue/transient state only. Nothing that must survive a restart
lives in Redis.

## Identity model

`PlatformUser` (human administrator) is deliberately distinct from the Windows
local users the platform manages on endpoints. Authorization is
**permission-based**: roles are bundles of permissions, and no authorization
decision ever inspects a role name. The permission catalogue is code
(`Permissions.cs`), seeded idempotently; built-in role grants are reconciled to
the code definition on every deployment, so out-of-band grants in the database
are reverted automatically.

## Configuration and secrets

- Strongly-typed options (`DatabaseOptions`, `RedisOptions`, `AgentOptions`)
  with data-annotation validation, validated at startup.
- Committed configuration files contain **no secrets**; connection strings are
  empty in `appsettings.json` and supplied via `ENDPOINTPLATFORM_`-prefixed
  environment variables or user-secrets. Startup fails loudly if missing.
- Local infrastructure credentials are generated per-machine into `infra/.env`
  (git-ignored); `infra/.env.example` documents the shape with placeholders.
- EF sensitive-data logging is refused outside the Development environment even
  if configured.

## Observability

- Serilog structured logging in both hosts and the agent.
- Every request gets a correlation id (`X-Correlation-Id`), validated as
  untrusted input, echoed in responses, attached to all log lines, and included
  in problem-details bodies.
- `/health/live` (process only) and `/health/ready` (PostgreSQL required,
  Redis degrades). Health responses expose check names and statuses only —
  never exception text or connection details.

## Current phase status

- **Phase 0 (foundation): complete.**
- **Phase 1 (secure enrollment + heartbeat): complete.** Enrollment tokens,
  per-device credentials, authenticated heartbeat, device list/counts in the
  dashboard. See ADR-0008.
- **Phase 2 (device inventory): complete.** Hardware/network/logged-on-user
  collection via WMI and managed APIs, pull-based refresh handshake through the
  heartbeat response, device detail page (Overview/Hardware/Network tabs).
- **Phase 3 (authentication + RBAC + audit enforcement): complete.** PBKDF2
  passwords, opaque revocable sessions (HttpOnly cookie + Bearer), permission
  policies on every admin endpoint, denial auditing, lockout and login rate
  limiting, operator bootstrap command, dashboard sign-in. See ADR-0009.
- **Phase 4 (read side, superseded by the entry above): complete.** Local
  users/groups/membership collected via System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement
  (SID-keyed, admin flag via well-known S-1-5-32-544 membership), ingested with
  the inventory snapshot, Users/Groups tabs on the device page.
  **Mutations (create/disable/reset password/change type/membership) are NOT
  implemented**: they are gated on an elevated Windows test environment and the
  typed-task delivery channel, per the phase's own safety requirements. The
  read/write split is structural — `ILocalAccountsCollector` is read-only and a
  separate mutation abstraction will be introduced with its own tests.
- **Phase 5 (device actions) + Phase 10 task-framework core: complete.**
  Typed, pull-based, per-permission, audited task pipeline (ADR-0010);
  restart/shutdown/lock/sign-out as typed tasks via Win32 IDeviceControl;
  dashboard Actions + Tasks tabs. Pipeline verified live with the benign
  Ping type; destructive executors unit-tested, not live-fired (need an
  elevated Windows host).
- **Phase 7 (software inventory): complete.** Installed apps read from the
  Windows uninstall registry (read-only), ingested with the inventory snapshot,
  device Software tab plus a fleet-wide Software page (search, publisher filter,
  per-title install counts, and a drill-down naming the devices a title is on).
- **Milestone 1.5.0 (complete software discovery): complete.** Three sources are
  read, all read-only and all registry: the 64-bit and 32-bit (WOW6432Node)
  machine uninstall keys, and the uninstall key of every **loaded user profile
  hive** under HKEY_USERS.

  The third is the substance. The agent runs as LocalSystem, so the previous
  `RegistryHive.CurrentUser` read resolved to SYSTEM's own profile — which holds
  no installed software at all. It contributed **zero rows across the entire
  fleet** while appearing to cover per-user installs, so every application that
  installs into a user profile by default was invisible: Zoom, Teams, Discord,
  OneDrive, Docker Desktop, VS Code's user installer, and most Electron apps.
  Reading HKEY_USERS instead recovered 7 such applications on the first machine
  tested, Zoom Workplace among them.

  **What it still does not see:** users who are fully signed out have no loaded
  hive. Reading those would mean `RegLoadKey` on a profile the agent does not
  own, which can fail on a locked or roaming profile and, if a hive were left
  mounted, block that user's next logon. Under-reporting a signed-out user is the
  safer failure and is a deliberate choice, not an oversight.

  Each entry now carries its **installation scope** (`Machine`/`User`), the
  **account** a per-user install belongs to, and the **MSI product code** where
  one exists — the last being the join between an installed application and an
  approved managed package. Normalization and de-duplication live in
  `SoftwareInventoryNormalizer`, a pure class in `EndpointAgent.Core` so the
  rules are tested with fixtures rather than against whatever a CI machine
  happens to have installed. An installation's identity is
  (name, version, publisher, scope, user): the same product installed for two
  people is two installations, because uninstalling one leaves the other running.

  Consequently **fleet install counts are over DISTINCT devices**, not rows — a
  machine where three people have the same application is one device, and
  counting rows would overstate the coverage an administrator decides on.

  `Architecture` is **not** the binary's architecture and is not presented as
  such: it records which uninstall registry view the entry was found in, and
  64-bit products routinely register under WOW6432Node (Chrome, Edge and Brave
  all report `x86`). The console labels it "Found in / registry view".

- **Milestone 1.5.0 (software deployment): complete.** A deployment is a durable
  record (`software_deployments` + `software_deployment_targets`) of an
  administrator's intent, targeting any mix of devices and groups in **one**
  request — the server resolves and authorizes every id rather than the console
  issuing a request per device.

  **Eligibility decides what is actually sent.** `SoftwareEligibilityEvaluator`
  compares the package against observed inventory per device: not present →
  install; older → update; same version → **no task**; newer → **never
  downgraded**; version unreadable → skipped and reported rather than guessed.
  Matching prefers the MSI product code (it survives a renamed display name) and
  falls back to name + publisher, because barely half of real installed entries
  have a product code. Every targeted device is recorded, skipped ones included —
  "nothing was sent to this machine, and here is why" is the answer to most
  questions asked after a deployment.

  `SoftwareVersion` is deliberately separate from `AgentVersionNumber`: the agent
  scheme insists on exactly three numeric parts, while real software reports
  `7.1.5 (43453)`, `152.0.7977.65` and `24.09`. It parses up to four leading
  components, ignores a trailing build tag, and returns *not comparable* rather
  than a guess.

  **Status is derived, never stored.** A target row holds the decision and the
  task id; progress comes from joining the task, so the console cannot show a
  stored status that has drifted from the tasks it claims to summarise.

  Tasks are queued through the existing `DeviceTaskService.QueueAsync`, which is
  what enforces retired-device exclusion, `MinimumAgentVersion` and the catalog
  definition. Nothing writes a task row directly. The agent path is unchanged:
  download, SHA-256, Authenticode signer pin, `msiexec`.

  Measured fan-out (single request, integration tests against real Postgres —
  developer machine, not a production benchmark): 10 devices 50 ms, 50 devices
  178 ms, 200 devices ~2.1 s, 350 devices ~3.9 s; reading a 200-device
  deployment ~110 ms. Resolution is a fixed number of queries regardless of fleet
  size; the residual per-device cost is `QueueAsync`'s own lookup and insert,
  kept deliberately rather than bypassed.

- **Deployment reliability (retry, cancel, offline): complete.** A retry is a new
  **attempt** on the same deployment, not a mutation of it: target rows carry an
  `Attempt` number and the unique index is (deployment, device, attempt), so
  "attempt 1 failed with a hash mismatch, attempt 2 succeeded" survives as a
  record. Retry re-runs the *whole* decision through the same `DecideAsync` path
  the original used — authorization, package lifecycle, retired state,
  eligibility — because a retry is a fresh decision about the world as it is now.
  A device that has since become compliant, moved to a newer version, been
  retired, or left the caller's scope is not sent an install because it failed an
  hour ago; a withdrawn package stops retries entirely.

  **Idempotency** is enforced by eligibility, not by the UI: a device with a
  Queued or Delivered task for the same package resolves as `AlreadyInProgress`,
  so a double-clicked Deploy, a browser retry, or a client retry after a network
  timeout all queue nothing the second time.

  **Cancel** stops only Queued work, reusing `DeviceTaskService.CancelAsync`. A
  delivered install is running on a Windows machine and is deliberately left
  alone — reporting it cancelled would be a claim the platform cannot support.
  Losing the race (the agent claims a task mid-sweep) is reported honestly as
  "cancelled N of M" rather than as a failure.

  **Offline is a distinct state.** A Queued task on a device silent for more than
  15 minutes reads as `Offline`, not `Pending` (which hides that nothing is
  coming) and not `Failed` (which sends an operator chasing a fault that does not
  exist). It is not "settled": the task still runs if the device returns before
  its TTL, after which it becomes `Expired` — also distinct from `Failed`, which
  means the endpoint tried and could not.

- **Force Stop application: complete.** From a device's installed-applications
  list an operator can stop a running application. It reuses the existing
  `DeviceTaskType.TerminateProcess` task, executor and PID-reuse guard — there is
  no second process-kill implementation, and no new table or migration.

  **The client names an application, never a process.** The request carries only
  the display name and publisher, both of which already exist in this platform's
  inventory; the server resolves them to concrete pids itself. A request cannot
  contain an image name, an executable path or a pid, so the browser cannot ask
  the fleet to terminate something arbitrary.

  **Resolution happens on the endpoint, at execution time.** The server chooses no
  pid: it queues one `StopApplication` task carrying the install directory, and
  the agent enumerates its own processes and matches them when it acts. Inventory
  is collected on request rather than continuously — a process list measured on
  this fleet was ninety minutes old — so a pid picked server-side would name a
  process that has very likely exited, restarted under a new pid, or had its pid
  reused, and the endpoint guard would then correctly refuse. That made Force Stop
  fail on applications that were running perfectly well. `StopApplication`
  requires **agent 1.6.0**; below that the console reports NotEligible rather than
  acting on stale data. 1.6.0 was built but never published — 1.7.0 is the first
  release in the fleet that carries it, and the catalog keeps 1.6.0 because that
  is the true minimum capability, not because such a build is deployed.

  **Resolution is by install path, not by name.** `ApplicationProcessMatcher`
  matches a process whose executable lives under the application's reported
  `InstallLocation`. A display name cannot be turned into an image name safely —
  "Microsoft Visual Studio Code" runs as `Code.exe`, "Google Chrome" as
  `chrome.exe` — and a name table would be wrong for every application nobody
  anticipated, where being wrong means terminating someone else's process. An
  over-broad install location (`C:\`, `C:\Windows`, a bare Program Files root) is
  refused outright, so one badly-registered application cannot become a request
  to terminate the operating system. Where there is no usable path the console
  says Force Stop is unavailable rather than guessing.

  **Recovering a missing install location (1.7.0).** Most uninstall keys do not
  carry `InstallLocation` — 19 of 33 on the reference machine — so most
  applications were unresolvable for a reason that had nothing to do with them.
  Two deterministic mechanisms recover one, and only these two. Windows Installer
  is asked which files it recorded for the product (`MsiEnumComponents` /
  `MsiEnumClients` / `MsiGetComponentPath`) and their common directory is used;
  failing that, a `DisplayIcon` is accepted when it points at an executable that
  exists and is not in an installer cache. Both are statements about what is on
  the machine. Neither infers anything from a name or a publisher, and no
  name-to-process table exists anywhere in the system. This took the reference
  machine from 14 to 25 of 33.

  Two things are deliberately *not* recovered. `MsiGetProductInfo(InstallLocation)`
  was empty for every product measured, and `InstallSource` names the media the
  installer ran from (`…\Downloads`, `…\Temp`) — acting on it would target
  whatever else was running from a downloads folder. And a `DisplayIcon` pointing
  into `Package Cache`, `Windows\Installer`, `Downloads` or `Temp` is rejected:
  four of the six that existed on the reference machine pointed at the *installer*
  rather than the application.

  The remainder stay unavailable, correctly — runtimes whose files go to
  System32, SDKs, a compatibility fix database. They have no single directory
  because they are not applications with one.

  **The agent will not stop itself.** The agent is an installed application and
  resolves like one, so both halves refuse it: the collector never reports the
  agent's own directory as an install location, and the matcher refuses any
  location that contains or is contained by it. The first keeps the console from
  offering a button that cannot work; the second means it could not work even if
  something else produced that path. An install location broad enough to contain
  the agent is refused entirely rather than merely filtered, because a root that
  wide was never one application's directory. Recovering a stopped agent needs
  someone physically at the endpoint, which is why this is guarded twice.

  Outcomes are reported apart — queued, not installed, not running, unresolvable,
  not eligible — because "not running" and "cannot ever be resolved" look
  identical to an operator told only that it failed. Gated on `task.execute`,
  device-scoped, retired devices excluded by `QueueAsync`, and audited with
  hostnames and outcomes but deliberately **not** executable paths.

- **Application execution control (enable/disable): NOT implemented, by
  decision — re-evaluated against Windows 11 Pro 26200 and re-confirmed.**

  Measured on a real fleet machine rather than argued from documentation:

  | Mechanism | Viable | Evidence |
  |---|---|---|
  | AppLocker | No | No AppLocker entitlement in this SKU's `ProductPolicy`; `AppIDSvc` is Stopped/Manual. Enforcement is Enterprise/Education. |
  | WDAC | No | `WldpApplyCiPolicy` is **not exported** from `wldp.dll` — there is no documented API to activate a policy. Activation needs `CiTool.exe` (a process launch, ADR-0005) or a reboot; compilation needs `ConvertFrom-CIPolicy` (PowerShell SDK, banned). A malformed CI policy can prevent boot. |
  | SRP | No | Present and registry-configurable, but deprecated by Microsoft **and** removable from the registry by a local administrator — and the interactive users on this fleet are local administrators, so the control would be removable by exactly the people it constrains. |
  | Smart App Control | No | State 0 (off); cannot be re-enabled without OS reinstall, and is all-or-nothing reputation, not per-application. |
  | IFEO | No | Hostile technique, antivirus-flagged, trivially bypassed. |
  | Windows Firewall | No | Blocks network, not execution. Labelling that "Disabled" would misrepresent it. |

  Real execution blocking therefore requires a dedicated application-control
  subsystem and, realistically, a Windows edition change. **`IsWithdrawn` remains
  catalogue state only** — "do not deploy this again" — and never blocks
  installed software. No Enable/Disable control is exposed, because a button that
  only flips a database boolean would be worse than its absence. The fleet runs Windows 11 Pro. AppLocker enforcement requires
  Enterprise/Education, so it is unavailable by edition. WDAC/App Control is
  available on Pro but cannot be applied under ADR-0005: the supported refresh is
  `CiTool.exe` (a process launch), policy compilation is a PowerShell cmdlet, and
  a malformed CI policy can prevent a machine booting. SRP is deprecated and
  trivially bypassed; IFEO debugger hijacking is a hostile technique. Real
  execution blocking therefore requires a dedicated application-control
  subsystem, and **catalogue withdrawal (`IsWithdrawn`) is not it** — withdrawing
  a package stops new deployments and does nothing to software already installed.
  The console must never imply otherwise.
- **Phase 4 (local user/group management) — COMPLETE (read + write).** Windows
  local accounts are now fully manageable, not just observable. Nine typed tasks
  (create/delete/enable/disable/reset-password/force-password-change/change-type/
  add-to-group/remove-from-group) run through the existing pipeline to
  `WindowsLocalAccountControl`, which calls netapi32 account-management APIs
  (`NetUserAdd`, `NetUserDel`, `NetUserSetInfo`, `NetLocalGroupAddMembers`,
  `NetLocalGroupDelMembers`) — no shell, no process launch, ADR-0005 intact and
  its scan unchanged. **Administrator status is real Windows state**: promotion
  adds the account to `BUILTIN\Administrators` (SID S-1-5-32-544) and demotion
  removes it; the dashboard reconciles against reported inventory rather than
  assuming success. Targets are addressed by SID (names are renameable).
  Passwords never persist: they go to an AES-GCM-sealed, 15-minute, one-time
  Redis entry and the task carries only a device-bound reference the agent
  redeems once (atomic GETDEL). Safety rules (built-in Administrator protected;
  last enabled administrator cannot be deleted/disabled/demoted) are enforced
  server-side against inventory AND re-checked by the agent against live Windows
  state. Authorization is permission AND device scope — new administrators are
  deny-by-default; pre-existing ones were migrated to organization-wide scope.
  Device Users/Groups tabs gained full management UI with explicit confirmation.
  See [ADR-0011](adr/0011-local-account-management.md).
- **Phase 15 (hardening / reporting / scale): complete.** Background task-expiry
  sweeper (Admin host, batched, backed by the `device_tasks(expires_at)` index)
  so tasks for offline devices still expire rather than firing late. Consolidated
  fleet report endpoint `/admin/v1/reports/summary` (device health, security and
  patch rollups, policy compliance, task throughput, active packages) surfaced on
  the dashboard. Hot query paths were indexed from the initial schema (verified:
  device lookup, task claim/expiry, audit composites). Operations runbook
  ([operations.md](operations.md)) covers backup/restore, credential and token
  rotation, offboarding, background jobs, scale and observability.
- **Phase 14 (offboarding): complete.** Offboarding a device is a *logical*,
  reversible operation: it revokes every active credential and retires the device
  (blocking heartbeat, inventory, tasks and re-enrollment), audited under
  `device.retire`. Reactivation reverses it — the machine must re-enroll for a
  fresh credential. There is deliberately **no destructive remote wipe**: an
  irreversible wipe would need its own guarded, explicitly-confirmed agent-side
  executor and is out of scope by design, not omission. Device detail Actions tab
  gains an offboard/reactivate control. Verified against real PostgreSQL:
  offboard revokes credentials + retires; a retired device is refused
  re-enrollment; reactivation restores it and re-enrollment issues exactly one
  fresh credential.
- **Phase 11 (software deployment): complete.** Approved MSI packages, deployed
  as typed `InstallPackage` tasks. Content-addressed package store (SHA-256 on
  write); the agent pulls the bytes, re-verifies the hash and the Authenticode
  signer (`WinVerifyTrust` + signer-subject pin), and installs through the
  Windows Installer service (`MsiInstallProduct`) - no process launch, no shell
  (ADR-0005 amendment). Idempotent by MSI ProductCode; reboots suppressed;
  `software.deploy` is high-risk and audited. Dashboard Packages panel (browser
  -computed SHA-256, register/deploy/withdraw). Verified live: an `InstallPackage`
  task for an already-present ProductCode was pulled, detected via the real
  `MsiQueryProductState`, and reported "already installed" - the full pipeline
  end-to-end with zero machine change. The install/download/signature paths are
  unit- and integration-tested; the real MSI detection and unsigned-file refusal
  are verified live; an actual install is never fired on the dev laptop.
- **Phase 8 (Windows Update visibility): complete.** Update history and
  reboot-pending state read via the Windows Update Agent (WUA) COM API
  (late-bound, no interop assembly) plus the reboot-pending registry keys -
  read-only, offline (local history store, never an online scan), no shell
  (ADR-0005). Ingested with the inventory snapshot (replace-wholesale, capped
  at 200 entries); failed-update count derived from Failed/Aborted results.
  Device Updates tab + fleet Updates page (reboot-pending and failed-update
  rollups). Verified live: this laptop's 26 real update-history entries
  (KB5121003, Defender intelligence updates, WindowsAppRuntime), reboot not
  pending, 2 genuine failed installs correctly counted.
- **Phase 12 (security posture): complete.** Defender/firewall/Secure Boot/TPM/
  BitLocker/local-admin-count read (read-only WMI + registry), null = "unknown"
  (never a false negative), compliance score over readable checks only, device
  Security tab + fleet Security page with score distribution. Verified live:
  this laptop scores 100% on readable checks; TPM/BitLocker correctly "unknown"
  unelevated.
- **Phase 9 (services & processes): complete.** Read-only service list and a
  capped point-in-time process snapshot in inventory (device Services/Processes
  tabs); controlled actions (service start/stop/restart, process terminate with
  an expected-image guard) as typed tasks via ServiceController/Process - no
  shell (ADR-0005, refined guard). Read side verified live (306 services, 60
  processes from this laptop); control executors unit-tested, not live-fired.
- **Phase 6 (policy engine v1): complete.** Desired-state architecture:
  Policy + immutable PolicyVersion (historical versions never mutated) +
  PolicyAssignment + PolicyComplianceResult; ScreenLockTimeout policy type;
  agent pulls effective policies, evaluates (read-only, never remediates),
  reports Compliant/NonCompliant/Unknown with deviations; heartbeat
  PoliciesPending handshake; Policies dashboard page. Verified live: create ->
  assign -> agent evaluated this laptop's real screen-lock -> reported Unknown
  with an honest deviation, audited. (EF key-generation fix: child entities
  added via a tracked parent's navigation now use ValueGeneratedNever so they
  insert rather than mis-update.)
- **Phase 13 (device groups): complete.** Static device groups with audited
  membership; policies can target a group, and GetEffectivePolicies resolves a
  device's policies through its group memberships (verified: group-targeted
  policy reaches members only, and leaves a device when it is removed). Groups
  dashboard page with membership management.
