# ADR-0005: The agent never executes shell commands

Status: accepted (Phase 0)

## Context

The agent runs as LocalSystem. The most dangerous pattern privileged agents
adopt is composing command strings ("net user " + name + " ...") and handing
them to cmd/PowerShell: every string that touches that path becomes a
potential privileged injection, and auditing "what did we actually run"
becomes string archaeology.

## Decision

The agent performs Windows work exclusively through APIs — Win32/P-Invoke,
WMI/CIM with fixed query text, System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement,
registry APIs — which take typed parameters and have no command line to
inject into.

The rule is enforced structurally, not by review: the agent assemblies do not
reference `System.Diagnostics.Process` or the PowerShell SDK **at all**
(`AgentSafetyTests` fails the build otherwise). WMI usage keeps query text
constant — no interpolation of runtime values into WQL.

When Phase 10 introduces approved-script execution, it will be a reviewed,
narrow call site behind the signed-script pipeline (hash + signature +
recorded approval), and the enforcement test will be tightened to allow
exactly that call site rather than removed.

## Consequences

- Local user/group management (Phase 4) must use account-management APIs even
  where a shell one-liner would be shorter. This is intended friction.
- No PowerShell SDK dependency keeps the agent's footprint and attack surface
  small.
- Anything genuinely impossible without a process launch is deferred to the
  Phase 10 pipeline rather than snuck in early.

## Amendment (Phase 9): process/service control

Phase 9 introduces service control (`ServiceController`) and process termination
(`Process.GetProcessById().Kill()` with an expected-image guard). These are NOT
the pattern ADR-0005 forbids: they take typed arguments and have no command line
to inject into. The enforcement test was therefore made *precise* rather than
loosened:

- `EndpointAgent.Core` still references no process API at all.
- A source scan asserts **`Process.Start` appears in no agent source file** -
  that is the actual shell/launch vector. `Kill`/`GetProcessById`/`GetProcesses`
  and `ServiceController` are permitted.
- The PowerShell-SDK ban is unchanged.

`Process.Start` (for approved-script execution) remains forbidden until the
signed-script pipeline exists, at which point the scan is tightened to allow
exactly that one reviewed call site.

## Amendment (Phase 11): MSI installation via the Windows Installer service

Phase 11 gives the agent a real software-install capability. This is the one
capability that appears to reopen the door ADR-0005 closes, so the boundary is
drawn deliberately:

- Installation is driven by **`MsiInstallProduct` (msi.dll)**, product detection
  by **`MsiQueryProductState`**, and there is **no process launch and no shell**.
  `Process.Start` remains absent from every agent source file (the
  `AgentSafetyTests` scan is unchanged and still passes). MSI is a data format
  consumed by a Windows service, not a command line the agent composes.
- The capability is **closed to signed MSI**. The package type enum has one
  member (`WindowsInstaller`); there is no `.exe`, no script, no arbitrary
  installer. Widening it is a reviewed code change, not configuration.
- **Two independent pins** gate every install, both verified on the agent:
  1. the content **SHA-256**, checked against the pin in the task payload before
     a byte reaches the installer; and
  2. the **Authenticode signer**, verified via `WinVerifyTrust` plus a signer
     -subject match, refusing an unsigned or untrusted file outright.
  A server tricked into serving the wrong bytes, or a network tamperer, cannot
  get anything installed: the hash check fails first, the signature check second.
- Installs are **idempotent by ProductCode** and reboots are **suppressed** (an
  install that wants one is reported, never performed). The privileged install
  runs as LocalSystem; the Admin API only ever stores content and queues intent,
  both audited (`software.deploy`, marked high-risk).

This does not reintroduce arbitrary execution: the agent cannot be made to run
anything other than a hash-pinned, signature-verified MSI that an administrator
holding `software.deploy` explicitly registered and deployed. The
`Process.Start`/PowerShell bans, and their enforcement test, are unchanged.
