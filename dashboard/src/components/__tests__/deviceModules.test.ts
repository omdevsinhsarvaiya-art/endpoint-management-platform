/**
 * The device page's module routing.
 *
 * These exist because of a real bug: the Drivers and BitLocker cards were added
 * to the tab type and to the feature grid, but not to the runtime whitelist the
 * URL guard checks. Clicking either card set `?m=drivers`, the guard rejected
 * it, the page fell back to the grid, and the click appeared to do nothing.
 *
 * TypeScript could not catch it. The whitelist was typed `Tab[]`, and a list
 * that omits some members of a union is still a valid array of that union — the
 * type said "everything here is a Tab", never "every Tab is here". The fix
 * derives the type from the list so the two cannot disagree; these tests hold
 * the runtime half of that guarantee.
