 * The lifecycle filter on the devices list.

 * Small surface, but the failure it guards against is quiet: "All" is not a status
 * the API understands, it is the absence of one. Sending it literally returns an
 * empty page, which on a device list reads as "no devices" rather than as a bug --
 * and since retiring devices is what puts rows into the Retired view, an operator
 * would most likely hit it just after retiring something and conclude the record
 * had been deleted.
