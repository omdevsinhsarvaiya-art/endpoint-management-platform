 * These were previously two separate declarations — a `Tab` union and a
 * `MODULES: Tab[]` whitelist — and adding a module to the union without adding
 * it to the array compiled cleanly, because a subset of `Tab[]` is a perfectly
 * valid `Tab[]`. The result was a card that set `?m=drivers`, a guard that

 * from `MODULES` makes the array the single source of truth: a module that is
 * not listed here does not exist as a type, so the two cannot drift apart.
