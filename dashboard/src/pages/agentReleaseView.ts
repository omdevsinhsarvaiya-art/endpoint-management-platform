 * after a newer one would have made the older one "latest". And it collapsed
 * three genuinely different questions into one, so a build that existed but was
 * not published was indistinguishable from one that did not exist at all.

 *
 *   - What is the newest build we hold?      (newestUploaded)
 *   - What is the newest build we offer?     (newestPublished)
